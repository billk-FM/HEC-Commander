# Hugging Face Assistants Now with Llama-3-Instruct and Cohere Command-R Models

We are excited to announce that Hugging Face Assistants now support two new Large Language Models (LLMs): **Llama-3-Instruct** and **Cohere Command-R**. These models offer capabilities and performance close to that of GPT-4, providing users with a powerful and free tool to test and experience the latest in LLM technology.

## New Model, New Possibilities

The Llama-3-Instruct and Cohere Command-R models bring a host of new features and improvements. While they do not support code interpretation, they excel in web search capabilities, which are now available for Hugging Face Assistants. This enables users to retrieve information and generate responses based on web data, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the assistant's output.

As these models are open-source and free to use, they offer a unique opportunity for users to experience cutting-edge LLM technology without any cost or access restrictions. This accessibility is a significant step towards democratizing AI and enabling a wider audience to explore the potential of LLMs.

## Updated Hugging Face Assistants

We have updated the following Hugging Face Assistants to utilize the new models, and users can easily switch between them to experience the enhanced capabilities:

## Limitations and Future Improvements

It is important to note that the current implementation of these models may have limitations, particularly for specific use cases that heavily rely on code interpretation. However, we believe that the web search capabilities and the overall performance of the models will still provide valuable insights and assistance to users.

We will continue to work on improving the Hugging Face Assistants and exploring ways to bring the best LLM technologies to our users. Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements!

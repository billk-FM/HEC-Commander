This version is free, but lacks a code interpreter and has a smaller context window than GPT-4.  Useful for smaller scripts or single code cells

## GPT Description
Transcription and editing assistant for voice notes.

## GPT Instructions
```
Voice notes transcription app.  

INPUT: 
This app will take raw, unformatted voice notes as input.

EDITING PLAN:
First provide a 2 sentence summary of the subject matter of the voice notes, describe the domain-specific expertise that would be best suited for editing this voice transcription.  Use that expertise for the duration of the editing plan.  

Analyze to determine any corrections or acronyms that were misidentified during the whisper voice transcription, and correcting those errors.  Also, if the user provides instructions to the note taker, such as “delete that” “go back”, etc, determine how to follow those instructions.

Basic grammatical corrections, spelling corrections, and sentence structure corrections can also be evaluated at this stage, and recommendations made for improvements to specific areas of the voice notes.

Analyze the full context of the voice notes and determine whether any phonetically similar but incorrect words were selected during transcription, and make a list of substitutions.

Identify and correct any words which may be referring to acronyms that were not recognized by the voice recognition.  The domain specific expertise should help with identifying which acronym is a best fit within the context of the voice notes.  

OUTPUT:
1. Editing Plan, written as a confident author and editor
2. Transcribed Voice Notes

Transcribed voice notes should exactly follow the voice notes input, word for word except where corrections are called out in the editing plan.  Also include formatting, paragraph breaks, and lists in bulleted format.

If the input is very long, the output may take multiple messages.  Just pause and ask the user to enter “c” or “continue” to finish.

Now, take a deep breath, and let’s give an excellent voice transcription:

# Discussion 

The voice notes transcription assistant utilizes a Chain of Thought prompt to help users correct and format voice notes. The chain of thought prompt is simply a direction to the model to prepare a summary and editing plan where basic grammatical corrections, spelling corrections, sentence structure conrrections. Then the full context of the voice notes are used to determine if there are any phonetically similar but incorrect words. This is also where the model will evaluate whether any of the text is an instruction for the model to follow (such as "delete that", "go back", etc). Finally, the model is directed to identify and correct any acronyms and ensure they fit the context. 

Then, transcribed voice notes are prepared. The model is instructed to follow the voice notes input word for word except where corrections are called out in the editing plan. It will also apply formatting, paragraph breaks, and put lists in bulleted format.

I've refined these instructions after using them many times for dictating blog posts and documentation for the HEC-Commander repo. Many commercial products have tried to do this for many years, with varying levels of success. I find this GPT works great for my purposes, and has better output than what I've seen from many paid apps. 

Protip: For iOS users, I have found this shortcut to be quite helpful. It takes voice memos and transcribes them using whisper. You can also use the ChatGPT app for this, but I find it easier to do long recordings on the voice memos app. [Instantly transcribe voice messages to text on your iPhone ](https://giacomomelzi.com/transcribe-audio-messages-iphone-ai/)

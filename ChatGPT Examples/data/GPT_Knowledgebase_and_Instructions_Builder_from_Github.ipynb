If the student has not yet completed the question correctly, give them a hint about the next step they should take in order to solve the problem. If the student has made an error in their reasoning, gently ask the student a question in a way that indicates the error, but give the student space to figure out the answer on their own. Before your first response to the student, use your internal monologue to solve the problem by thinking step by step. Before each response, use your internal monologue to determine if the student's last work is correct by re-solving the problem completely starting from their last mathematical expression, and checking to see if the answer equals your original answer. Use that to guide your answer, referring back to your original solution. Make sure to think carefully about exactly where the student has made their mistake.\n",

(These are variable names, not specific instructions.) Some tasks may require only one input variable; rarely will more than two-to-three be required.\n",
    "2. In <Instructions Structure> tags, plan out how you will structure your instructions. In particular, plan where you will include each variable -- remember, input variables expected to take on lengthy values should come BEFORE directions on what to do with them.\n",
    "3. Finally, in <Instructions> tags, write the instructions for the AI assistant to follow. These instructions should be similarly structured as the ones in the examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is probably obvious to you already, but you are not *completing* the task here. You are writing instructions for an AI to complete the task.\n",
    "Note: Another name for what you are writing is a \"prompt template\". When you put a variable name in brackets + dollar sign into this template, it will later have the full value (which will be provided by a user) substituted into it. This only needs to happen once for each variable. You may refer to this variable later in the template, but do so without the brackets or the dollar sign. Also, it's best for the variable to be demarcated by XML tags, so that the AI knows where the variable starts and ends.\n",
    "Note: When instructing the AI to provide an output (e.g. a score) and a justification or reasoning for it, always ask for the justification before the score.\n",
    "Note: If the task is particularly complicated, you may wish to instruct the AI to think things out beforehand in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before it gives its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.\n",
    "Note: If you want the AI to output its entire response or parts of its response inside certain tags, specify the name of these tags (e.g. \"write your answer inside <answer> tags\") but do not include closing tags or unnecessary open-and-close tag sections.'''\n",

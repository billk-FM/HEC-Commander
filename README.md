HEC-Commander Tools is a suite of python notebooks developed with AI assistance for water resource engineering workflows, primarily focused on providing automation for HEC-RAS and HEC-HMS through Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, this repository contains blog posts and ChatGPT assistants relevant to H&H modeling, automation and the use of LLM's for water resources workflows.

Developed to support Region 4 of the Louisiana Watershed Initiative by Fenstermaker.  (Not affiliated with HEC, content is exclusively third party automation utilizing publicly available software)

## [HMS-Commander](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/tree/main/HMS-Commander)
Contains automation scripts for HEC-HMS that allow the generation of multiple DSS output files with user-defined calibration parameters. This tool was developed to support 1D HEC-RAS calibration and validation workflows using deficit and constant loss methods with optional recession baseflow, and employs a user-generated CSV file to input scale factors for each individual parameter. A second version of teh script allows definition of multiple calibration regions, enabling spatial variability of scale factors.

## [RAS-Commander](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/tree/main/RAS-Commander)
Includes a suite of HEC-RAS automation scripts that support the parallel execution of HEC-RAS unsteady plans, as well as construction of plan files utilizing multiple HEC-HMS inputs. Defines DSS output file names, generates batch scripts for headless execution, and manages the deployment and parallel execution of HEC-RAS runs on local and remote machines using peer-to-peer Windows network shares. These scripts are applicable for both 1D and 2D model formats, and now support overriding RASMapper infiltration override layers.

## [DSS-Commander](https://github.com/billk-FM/HEC-Commander/tree/main/DSS-Commander)
Provides a script for plotting 1D HEC-RAS results from DSS against gauge results, creating zoomable HTML plots with Bokeh. It calculates calibration statistics (RMSE, r, PBIAS, NSE) for each plotted location and supports multiple gauges, as well as the plotting of multiple DSS results files for both Stage and Flow.

## Miscellaneous Scripts and Tools
Under each HMS, RAS, and DSS Commander folders are miscellaneous scripts and tools to assist with workflows related to those programs.  These include soil statistics tools, tools for setting ineffective flow area permanency + more.

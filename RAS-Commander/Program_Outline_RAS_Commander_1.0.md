This cell is essential for the operational aspect of the RAS-Commander application, enabling automated and remote execution of HEC-RAS projects in a distributed environment. It showcases the application's ability to handle complex execution scenarios efficiently and securely.


# Summary of Cell 15: Results Postprocessing and Cleanup

## Content Overview:
This cell handles postprocessing and cleanup after the execution of HEC-RAS projects. It focuses on aggregating results from remote directories and managing the cleanup of these directories. The key functionalities include:

1. **Gathering Remote Subfolders**:
   - `get_remote_subfolders`: A function to retrieve a list of subfolders from given remote folders. It corrects the paths using the globally defined `Remote_File_Share_Path`.

2. **Copying Results to Project Folder**:
   - The script iterates over remote subfolders to find and copy specific files back to the main HEC-RAS project folder. It focuses on files that match certain criteria, including DSS search filters and file extensions.

3. **Error Handling and File Copying Logic**:
   - The script includes logic to handle errors during file access and to skip certain files based on predefined criteria.
   - `copy_file`: A function to copy files from the source to the destination, replacing the destination file if the source is newer.

4. **User Confirmation for Cleanup**:
   - The script requests user confirmation before deleting files, folders, and subfolders in the deploy targets. This is done to prevent accidental data loss.
   - `request_deletion_confirmation`: A function that creates a popup window for deletion confirmation.

5. **Deletion of Remote Directories**:
   - After user confirmation, the script proceeds to delete all files and directories in the target folders, using the safety prefix to guide the deletion process.

## Key Points:
- The cell ensures that all relevant results are collected from remote directories and stored in the main project folder.
- The careful handling of file copying and deletion, including user confirmation for deletions, reflects a focus on data integrity and user safety.
- The inclusion of error handling and specific file selection criteria demonstrates a nuanced approach to postprocessing.

## Important Variables and Functions:
- `get_remote_subfolders(target_folders)`
- `Remote_File_Share_Path`
- `DSS_Search_Filter_Include`
- `copy_file(source_file, destination_file)`
- `request_deletion_confirmation()`

This cell is crucial for the final stages of the RAS-Commander application's execution, ensuring that all results are properly aggregated and that the remote environments are cleaned up after use. It showcases the application's comprehensive approach to project management, from execution to postprocessing and cleanup.

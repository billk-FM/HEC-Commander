## Purpose

The Terrain Modification Profile Generator is a Python notebook designed for generating detailed terrain profiles. These profiles are crucial for accurate floodplain mapping and hydrological modeling, especially in conjunction with tools like HEC-RAS. The script reads terrain modification data and creates elevation profiles that can be integrated into terrain modification projects.

## Instructions for Input Files

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following files available:

- A GeoJSON file containing terrain modification polylines.
- Terrain TIFF files compatible with HEC-RAS RASMapper.

These files should be prepared and checked for accuracy as they directly influence the output profiles generated by this script.

## User Inputs

### User-Defined Variables

Users are required to input the following variables for the script to function correctly:

| Variable                | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Profile_Segment_Length  | Length of Segment for Lowest Point Groupings (in meters)     |
| Profile_Vertical_Adjust | Vertical Adjustment Applied to Lowest Points = -0.25         |
| Sampling_Interval       | Raster Sampling Interval (in meters)                         |
| Projection_File_Path    | HEC-RAS RASMapper Projection File                            |

### File Paths for Terrain Modifications and Terrain TIFFs

You must specify the paths to your terrain modifications and terrain TIFF files:

| Variable          | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| RASTerrainMods    | GEOJSON containing terrain modification polylines |
| RASTerrainTiff1   | HEC-RAS RASMapper Terrain TIFF file               |

## Script Output

The script generates a CSV file containing a profile for each terrain modification polyline. These profiles can be directly used in the terrain modification editor in RASMapper.

Example of output format:

| PolylineID      | STA      | Elevation |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| Profile Line 1  | 0        | 43.46875  |
| Profile Line 1  | 2963.51  | 33.21875  |
| ...             | ...      | ...       |
| Profile Line 2  | 0        | 43.46875  |
| Profile Line 2  | 2963.51  | 33.21875  |
| ...             | ...      | ...       |

This CSV can be imported into relevant software for further analysis or application.

## Additional Notes

- The script includes error checking for data input and provides informative messages in case of issues.
- It is essential to ensure that the input GeoJSON and TIFF files are correctly formatted and projected for accurate results.
- The output CSV should be reviewed for accuracy before being used in any critical applications.

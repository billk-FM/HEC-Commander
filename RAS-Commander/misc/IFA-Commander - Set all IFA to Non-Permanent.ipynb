    "PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THIS SCRIPT: \n",
    "When using Rasmapper to implement IFA's, as of version 6.4 it will create all IFAs as permanent by default\n",
    "Since the typical Ineffective flow area at a overtopping structure needs to be non-permanenet, this script allows changing all IFAs to non-permanent\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION: \n",
    "In the HEC-RAS Geometry file, the permanence of Ineffective Flow Areas (IFAs) is denoted by \" T \" for True (permanent) and \" F \" for False (non-permanent)\n",
    "This script wil search and replace all values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:\n",
    "Allow the user to manually toggle the permanenence of each IFA in the geometry file, then use the script to generate a list of IFA's that were toggled\n",
    "and maintain permanence while revising the rest of the geometry file.\n",
    "\n",

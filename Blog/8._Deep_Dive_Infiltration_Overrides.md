# Programmatic Modification of HEC-RAS 2D Geometries to Set Infiltration Base Overrides using H5py

## Introduction
HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System) is a widely used software for hydrological modeling and river analysis. One of the critical components in these models is the accurate representation of infiltration parameters. However, manually updating these parameters can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with multiple scenarios or large datasets. This is where programmatic modification using Python and the H5py library comes into play, enabling efficient and automated updates to infiltration base overrides in HEC-RAS 2D geometries.

## Background
HEC-RAS utilizes HDF5 files (.hdf) to store and organize data efficiently. These files follow a specific structure and contain datasets that define the model's behavior. The H5py library in Python provides a convenient way to interact with and modify these HDF5 files programmatically. By leveraging the power of H5py, we can automate the process of updating infiltration parameters in HEC-RAS geometries.

## Why Modify the Geometry File instead of the Infiltration Layer
When working with HEC-RAS, it's important to understand the significance of making changes to the geometry file (base overrides) instead of directly modifying the infiltration layer. The geometry layer edits allow multiple variations to persist and be verifiable, as the geometry is copied along with the results. In contrast, the infiltration layer parameters are not saved with the results. By modifying the geometry HDF file after creating a calibration region, we ensure that the necessary base overrides HDF tables are created, providing a robust and reproducible approach to parameter updates.

## Technical Deep Dive: Using H5py to Modify .gxx.hdf Files
Let's dive into the technical details of using H5py to modify the .gxx.hdf files in HEC-RAS. These files follow a specific structure, and understanding this structure is crucial for making accurate modifications. The key function that enables the programmatic update of infiltration base overrides is `scale_infiltration_data`. Here's a breakdown of how this function works:

'''
def scale_infiltration_data(hdf_file_path, infiltration_df, scale_md, scale_id, scale_pr):
    hdf_path_to_overwrite = '/Geometry/Infiltration/Base Overrides'
    
    with h5py.File(hdf_file_path, 'a') as hdf_file:
        if hdf_path_to_overwrite in hdf_file:
            del hdf_file[hdf_path_to_overwrite]

        dt = np.dtype([
            ('Land Cover Name', 'S7'),
            ('Maximum Deficit', 'f4'),
            ('Initial Deficit', 'f4'),
            ('Potential Percolation Rate', 'f4')
        ])

        structured_array = np.zeros(infiltration_df.shape[0], dtype=dt)
        structured_array['Land Cover Name'] = np.array(infiltration_df['Name'].astype(str).values.astype('|S7'))
        structured_array['Maximum Deficit'] = infiltration_df['Maximum Deficit'].values.astype(np.float32)
        structured_array['Initial Deficit'] = infiltration_df['Initial Deficit'].values.astype(np.float32)
        structured_array['Potential Percolation Rate'] = infiltration_df['Potential Percolation Rate'].values.astype(np.float32)

        hdf_file.create_dataset(
            hdf_path_to_overwrite,
            data=structured_array,  
            dtype=dt,
            compression='gzip',
            compression_opts=1,
            chunks=(100,),
            maxshape=(None,)
        )
        
    return infiltration_df
'''

The function takes the following arguments:
- `hdf_file_path`: The path to the .gxx.hdf file to be modified.
- `infiltration_df`: A pandas DataFrame containing the infiltration data to be scaled and written to the HDF5 file.
- `scale_md`, `scale_id`, `scale_pr`: Scale factors for Maximum Deficit, Initial Deficit, and Potential Percolation Rate, respectively.

The function performs the following steps:
- Opens the HDF5 file in append mode using `h5py.File()`.
- Checks if the dataset to be overwritten exists and deletes it if necessary.
- Defines a structured data type (dt) that matches the expected structure in the HDF5 file.
- Creates a structured array using the infiltration DataFrame and the defined data type.
- Writes the structured array to the HDF5 file using `create_dataset()`, specifying compression options and chunk size.
- Returns the scaled infiltration DataFrame for verification purposes.

It's important to note that the function uses specific data types and compression options that are compatible with HEC-RAS. Modifying these options may lead to issues with the HEC-RAS solver.

## Implementing the scale_infiltration_data Function in Your Workflow
To integrate the `scale_infiltration_data` function into your existing Python workflow, follow these steps:
- Ensure that you have the h5py and pandas libraries installed in your Python environment.
- Prepare your infiltration data as a pandas DataFrame with the required columns:
  - 'Name': Land cover names
  - 'Maximum Deficit'
  - 'Initial Deficit'
  - 'Potential Percolation Rate'

Here's an example of creating a sample DataFrame:
''' 
data = {
    'Name': ['Grass', 'Concrete', 'Soil'],
    'Maximum Deficit': [7, 1, 5],
    'Initial Deficit': [2, 0.1, 1.75],
    'Potential Percolation Rate': [1, 0.25, 0.8]
}
infiltration_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
'''

- Specify the path to your .gxx.hdf file and the desired scale factors:
''' 
hdf_file_path = 'path_to_your_hdf5_file.hdf5'
scale_md = 1.2
scale_id = 1.1
scale_pr = 0.9
'''

- Call the `scale_infiltration_data` function with the appropriate arguments:
''' 
scaled_df = scale_infiltration_data(hdf_file_path, infiltration_df, scale_md, scale_id, scale_pr)
'''

- Verify the changes by inspecting the scaled DataFrame returned by the function:
''' 
print("Scaled Infiltration Data:")
print(scaled_df)
'''

## Challenges and Solutions
When implementing the `scale_infiltration_data` function, you may encounter some challenges related to the specific HDF5 options required by the HEC-RAS unsteady solver. Here are a few common issues and their solutions:
- **Incorrect HDF5 Options**: The most common challenge when editing geometry files is using the correct HDF5 options that exactly match the existing HDF5 file. The RAS unsteady solver requires strict adherence to the original structured array, chunking, shape, and compression options when making edits to the .gxx.hdf file. Failure to use the exact same options can result in solver errors.
  - **Solution**: Use HDFView, a visual tool for browsing and editing HDF5 files, to inspect the existing HDF5 file and ensure that the options used in the `scale_infiltration_data` function match precisely.

- **Complex HDF5 Options**: Setting the correct HDF5 options programmatically can be challenging, especially when dealing with structured arrays, compression, and chunking.
  - **Solution**: Leverage AI-assisted coding techniques, such as using the h5py documentation and examples, to set the parameters correctly.
  - **H5py Documentation - Datasets**: [https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/dataset.html](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/dataset.html)
- **Lack of Examples**: Finding specific examples of editing HEC-RAS geometry files using Python can be difficult, making it harder to understand the required steps and options.
  - **Solution**: Refer to the RAS-Commander Notebook, specifically Code Cell #9, which demonstrates how to update geometry HDF files with new infiltration grid base overrides. This code cell provides a practical example of using the `scale_infiltration_data` function and can serve as a starting point for your own implementation.
